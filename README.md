# NaN is a function!
Wish NaN was a function? Now it is! This great library is the best library that returns NaN that you can find!

## usage

```javascript
"use strict" // still works in strict mode!

var NaN = require('nan-is-a-function') // we have to use var or it will give us an error in strict mode

console.log(NaN()) // prints NaN 
```
